Let's take a simple example, a peach.
We only have one peach and there's a lot of people that want to eat it.
The solution to share with everyone is by creating a __virtual__ peach, like that everyone thinks that they have their own peach when we have the __physical__ peach.

The same way is applied to the CPU.
We have the __physical__ CPU, and each application gets its own __virtual CPU__.
The program thinks it has the CPU all for itself when in reality WE have it, with many processes sharing the CPU.
