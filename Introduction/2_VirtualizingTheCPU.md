This part of the book just covers what we're going to learn with examples of the CPU, memory and disk using concurrency, PID, etc.

# design goals.

So we need to virtualize the hardware into the OS (except the disk).
build up __abstractions__ it's fundamental to what we do in computer science.
Abstraction makes writing a larger program simple with small pieces, write with a high level language like C and not using assembly without thinking about logic gates and to build processors without thinking too much about transistors.

another goal is __performance__; another way to say __minimize overheads__.
Virtualization and making the OS easy to use as well worth it.

__protections__ using isolation.
__reliability__  to run 24/7
__energy efficiency__ to not kill the world
__security__
__mobility__
